# My personal homepage.
I wanted a place where I could showcase the projects I have done during the years and at the same 
time teach myself something new. This is the result. 

This project is possibly something that I will never stop working on. There will probably always be
something that I want to change or add to it so if you stop by in a few weeks you might find something
new.
