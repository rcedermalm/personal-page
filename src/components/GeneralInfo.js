                My name is Rebecca Cedermalm and I am a girl born 1995 with a passion for computer graphics. 
                I am currently studying my fifth and last year at the Master of Science program of Media 
                Technology at Linkoping University in Sweden. The short version of what the program contains is: 
                programming, computer graphics and information visualization combined with the regular engineering parts. 
                The reason I chose Media Technology is the unique combination of maths and creative visualisations.

                During my free time I love to spend my time reading, watching movies or creating something fun visually. 
                The fun part can be everything between a splash of paint on a canvas to hobby projects using code. 
              </p>

                My dream work place is at a company where I have the change to learn and implement new techniques, preferably 
                in the film or game industry.

                  So, what is this page?
                  My intentions with this page is a way for myself and my future employers to keep track on what 
                  I have done during my years in the technology field. A trip down memory lane in the form of an 
                  extended resum√©, so to speak.
